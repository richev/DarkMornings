<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Nobody likes commuting in the dark, so @Html.ActionLink("Dark Mornings", "Index", "Home") uses your location and commute times to calculate when you will next be commuting in glorious daylight (or horrid darkness, depending on the time of year).</p>
<p>In the winter, count down the days until it will be light again.</p>
<p>In summer, enjoy those daylight commutes.</p>
<h3>Who?</h3>
<p>@Html.ActionLink("Dark Mornings", "Index", "Home") was hastily designed and built by <a href="http://twitter.com/richev">Richard</a>. If you encounter any inaccuracies or issues with the site then please let me know.</p>
<p></p>
<p>@Html.ActionLink("Dark Mornings", "Index", "Home") comes with no guarantees. If you are unsure whether it is daylight during your commute, please look up from your phone and out of the window of your train or car.</p>
<h3>How?</h3>
<p>Your approximate location is determined either by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C_Geolocation_API">asking your browser</a> (more accurate), or based on your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_location">IP address</a> (less accurate).</p>
<p>IP Address-based location lookup from <a href="http://www.hostip.info/">hostip.info</a>.</p>

<h3>And?</h3>
<p>The timezone of your computer/tablet/phone is used, so if you're on the road and your PC timezone is not set to the local timezone then you may get incorrect results.</p>
<p>Depending on the times of your commutes, it may be that the switch to or from daylight-savings time can plunge you back into darkness. To keep things simple, @Html.ActionLink("Dark Mornings", "Index", "Home") won't tell you if this is the case. It just lets you know the first dates when your commutes will be completely in the light or dark.</p>
